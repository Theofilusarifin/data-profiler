# Data Profiler

A data profiling tool designed to analyze and understand the structure, quality, and distribution of data. This project uses [WhyLogs](https://whylabs.ai/) to generate data profiles, which help detect anomalies, track data drift, and improve data quality.

## Features

- **Data Quality Checks**: Identify missing values, outliers, and unexpected patterns in data.
- **Data Drift Detection**: Monitor changes in data distribution over time.
- **Integration with WhyLabs**: Automatically upload data profiles for centralized monitoring and analysis.
- **Customizable Cadence**: Set hourly or daily profiling schedules.
